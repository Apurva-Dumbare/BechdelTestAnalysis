# Bechdel-Test: Data Analysis of Gender Disparity in Hollywood
# Overview
This project analyzes gender disparity in Hollywood films using the Bechdel Test. The Bechdel Test is a measure of female representation in films, created by cartoonist Alison Bechdel. This analysis aims to provide insights into how gender representation has changed over time and highlight disparities within the film industry.

# Bechdel Test Criteria
The Bechdel Test evaluates a film based on the following criteria:

1) It has to have at least two named female characters.
2) These female characters must talk to each other.
3) They must discuss something other than a man.
A film passes the Bechdel Test if it meets all three criteria. While the test is a useful indicator, it does not assess the depth or quality of female characters' roles.

# Project Components

 1) Data Collection: Sourced Bechdel Test data and additional information on film demographics.
 2) Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
 3) Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in gender representation.
 4) Visualization: Created visualizations to represent the findings and trends over time.
